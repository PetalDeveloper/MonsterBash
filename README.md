# MonsterCoinBash
MiniCar coin collector: You roll around the track collecting coins making sure to avoid the monsters that appear and try to attack you it's as simple as that.

Controls: You use wasd to move around the track and space to shoot out the pellets infornt of the car.

How to play: Once you spawn in you move either left, right or forwards and start collecting coins that spawn random in certain spots around the map. The goal is to see how long you can survive the monsters and how many coins you collect before you fall to them, it gives a self goal to beat your previous highest coin and timer mark.

DevLog: I designed the movement of both the player and the monsters making sure the monsters would vanish after a certian time so they wouldn't overload the game and so they wouldn't go in eachothers area. 

Assets: an asset I created myself was the car using maya and the pixel art using a online website actually called Pixilart.
